Phase 1 -> Appendix
Created March 17, 2024
by Sakib Rasul

Objectives
1. Learn about the following advanced programming concepts:
   - First-class citizens
   - Compilation and execution
   - Algorithmic complexity

2. Learn about the following advanced JavaScript concepts:
   - Immediate invocation
   - Context
   - Array methods
   
Takeaways
- When faced with a problem, (a) understand its objectives and edge cases, (b) write some solution,
       and then (c) work towards case coverage and optimal time and space complexity.
- Hold onto `map` and `filter` for Phase 2!

// ~ First-Class Citizens
// A **first-class** object or **citizen** is one that has every capability a language has to offer.
// In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens.

// ~ Compilation and Execution
// During **compilation**, JavaScript allocates memory for your code, and understands its scope(s).
// During **execution**, JavaScript runs your code line-by-line, stores values in variables, and executes functions.

// ~ Algorithms in Time and Space
// An **algorithm** is a set of instructions that, when run, accomplish some task.
// **Big O notation** is a way of quantifying how "good" an algorithm is.
// By "good", we mean fast (no. of small operations) and/or small (amount of memory taken up by operations).
// Big O describes this "goodness" as a factor of n, the algorithm's input size.
// Common big O descriptions include:
// - O(1): **constant** speed or memory
// - O(log n): **logarithmic** speed or memory
// - O(n): **linear** speed or memory
// - O(n^2): **quadratic** speed or memory
// - O(n^2), O(n^3), etc.: **exponential** speed or memory

// ~ Immediate Invocation
console.log("~~IMMEDIATE INVOCATION~~");
// We can immediately invoke functions upon declaration with (definition)(arguments).
((a, b) => console.log(a - b))(10, 3);

// ~ Context
console.log("~~CONTEXT~~");
// -> A function's **context** is an object it can access with the keyword `this`.
function greet(end) {
  console.log("Hello there, " + this.name + end);
}
// -> We can use the function methods `apply`, `call`, and `bind` to define a function's context.
// -> function.apply(this, [arguments]);
greet.apply(
  {
    name: "Sakib",
    friend: "Vinh",
  },
  ["!"]
);
//    executes `function` with an object reference and array of arguments.
// -> function.call(this, ...arguments);
greet.call({ name: "Alessandro" }, "?");
greet.call({ name: "Vinny" }, "?");
//    executes `function` with an object reference and list of arguments.
// -> function.bind(this, ...arguments);
const greetJames = greet.bind({ name: "James" }, ".");
greetJames();
//    returns a function with an object reference and array of arguments.

// ~ Advanced Array Methods
console.log("~~ADVANCED ARRAY METHODS~~");
// `forEach` isn't the only array method out there. Let's learn about a few more!
// Hint: For the purposes of Phase 2, `filter` and `map` are most relevant.
const prices = [30, 20, 10, 5, 45];
// -> array.find() returns the first element that satisfies some condition.
console.log(prices.find((price) => price < 20));
// -> array.reduce() accumulates a value by applying a function to each element in an array.
console.log(
  prices.reduce((sum, price) => sum + price),
  3
);
// -> array.filter() returns an array with only the elements that satisfy some condition.
console.log(prices.filter((price) => price < 20));
// -> array.map() returns an array where each element has been transformed in some specified way.
console.log(prices.map((price) => price * 2));
console.log(prices);

// ~ Challenges
// 1. Write a function that takes an array of sentences and returns only those that are questions.
// 2. Write a function that takes an array of lowercased sentences and returns them capitalized.
// capitalizeSentences(phrases); // ["Hello, there!", "How are you?", "It's me!"];
// console.log(phrase); // ["Hello, there!", "How are you?", "It's me!"]
const phrases = ["hello, there!", "how are you?", "It's me!"]; // example array for #1 and #2
const questionPhrases = phrases.filter((phrase) => {
  return phrase.slice(-1) === "?";
});
console.log(questionPhrases);

const capPhrases = phrases.map((phrase) => phrase.toUpperCase());
console.log(capPhrases);
